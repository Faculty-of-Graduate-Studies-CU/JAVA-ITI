# Java Applets

Java applets are small Java programs designed to be embedded within HTML web pages and executed within a web browser environment. They function on the client side, meaning the applet's code is downloaded to the user's system and run by the browser's Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## Key Characteristics of Java Applets

### Client-Side Execution
Applets run within the user's web browser, leveraging the client's resources for processing and display.

### Web Integration
They are embedded in HTML pages using tags like `<applet>` or `<object>`, allowing for interactive web content beyond static HTML.

### Lifecycle Methods
Applets have a defined lifecycle managed by the browser's Java Plug-in, including methods like:
- `init()`
- `start()`
- `stop()`
- `destroy()`

These methods handle initialization, execution control, and cleanup.

### GUI Capabilities
Applets can utilize Java's Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) or Swing libraries to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and provide interactive elements.

### Security Model
Applets traditionally operated within a restricted security sandbox to prevent malicious code from accessing the user's system resources without permission.

## Historical Context and Decline

Java applets gained popularity in the early days of the web for their ability to deliver dynamic and interactive content. However, their use has significantly declined due to several factors:

### Security Concerns
Applets historically faced security vulnerabilities, leading to concerns about potential exploits and malware.

### Browser Support Decline
Major web browsers have largely discontinued or deprecated support for Java applet plugins due to security risks and the rise of alternative web technologies.

### Emergence of Alternatives
Modern web development relies on technologies like:
- JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Various frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js)

These technologies create rich and interactive web experiences, offering more secure and performant solutions than Java applets.
